This is Zen Wang's home on the web!

I will be traveling to Aarhus University in February 2024 to begin graduate studies in computer engineering. During the period before the school year starts, I will learn C++ related development knowledge, and I will write a thesis on software testing as a summary of my previous year's work. Besides, I'm looking for possible industry internships or lab work, let me know if I fit your needs! 

I love fitness outside of work, so if you have the same interest feel free to talk to me.
