Online purchasing reviews are a prevalent occurrence.  R-T-Q models are used to demonstrate the potential of star ratings as a predictor of product popularity.Initially, the natural language processing (NLP) system conducted a thorough examination of the data and assigned emotional scores to eligible assessments. The data is clustered into three categories using the k-means++ algorithm. The study used the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Markov Chain Model to construct a Time-based Reputation Judgment Model for the purpose of monitoring changes in reputation. The reputation weights were computed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), while the process was described by the use of Markov Chain transfer matrices.Subsequently, a Variable Combination Model is formulated in order to ascertain the star rating and review score that define the success or failure of a product. In addition, the R-Q Factor Analysis Model included the element of time. The present work employs a distinctive R-T-Q factor analysis model to demonstrate that the presence of extreme ratings might potentially result in the generation of extreme reviews. This study revealed that individuals mostly report negative purchasing experiences. The organization has the capacity to readily modify its methodology to similar obstacles.
