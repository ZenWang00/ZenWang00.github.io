This is Zen Wang's home on the web!

I joined Thoughtworks as a Quality Engineer in 2022 after graduating from the Hubei University with a bachelor's degree in computer science and technology. While my current role as a Quality Engineer has been immensely rewarding, I am eager to explore new career possibilities and broaden my horizons. My ambition extends beyond my current role, and I am actively seeking opportunities that will allow me to leverage my current skills while also acquiring new ones. I am driven by the desire to contribute meaningfully to projects, explore fresh challenges, and evolve as a professional.

I will be traveling to Aarhus University in February 2024 to begin graduate studies in computer engineering.
